Today marks the beginning of an exciting journey—I’m officially starting work on my very first PC game, "SLIMO"!<br>
<br>
As an aspiring indie game developer, I’ve always dreamed of creating games from scratch, learning everything along the way. And today, that dream starts to take shape.<br>
<br>
SLIMO will be my first project, a game made entirely by me, with no shortcuts—just creativity, determination, and a lot of learning.

I know there will be challenges, bugs, and moments of frustration, but I’m ready to embrace every step.<br>
<br>
This is the start of a journey into game development, and I can’t wait to share updates, progress, and lessons learned along the way.
