    Today I finished improving the slime’s movement, and it already makes the game feel noticeably better to play.
    The slime now moves more smoothly and responsively, with better control over direction changes and momentum.
    Fine-tuning the movement logic helped remove stiffness and made actions feel more natural, especially during jumps and landings. 
    These adjustments may be subtle, but they greatly improve overall game feel.

    In addition to movement, I also enhanced the environment by adding fog and dust particle effects. 
    The fog helps add depth to the world, while the dust particles bring a sense of motion and life to the scene.
    Together, they make the environment feel more atmospheric without taking attention away from gameplay.
    These improvements bring the game one step closer to the experience I’m aiming for. 
    I’ll continue refining both mechanics and visuals as development moves forward.

      More updates coming soon. 🚀
